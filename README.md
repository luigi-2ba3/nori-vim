*\* Nori-vim because it is a Hidamari Sketch reference (Nori is quite the techie tenant of Hidamari-s≈ç just like us!)*, but it does have a ring to it like Neovim! ü§≠

---
My Neovim configuration folder which concurrently uses both `init.vim` and `init.lua` in its root (`lua/init.lua`) (I have no idea if this is a klunky practice‚ÄîI just want to distinctly separate what are the vim ones from the Lua ones)

Built with Neovim 0.10.4 on macOS with love ‚ù§Ô∏è

## Installation

***For now, this only works on macOS, UNIX, and should be on Linux.*** I might consider making one for Windows (but WSL is better).

Simply clone this into your `nvim` folder (on macOS, for example, it is in `~/.config/nvim`) and make sure to execute `firstTimeSetup.bash` which is just a fancy script to install **vim-plug**, my plugin manager which takes care of the plugins I have on my Neovim config here!
